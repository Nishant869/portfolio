            <p>
                Results-driven Technical Lead and Full Stack Engineer with 7.9 years of experience designing,
                developing, and delivering scalable enterprise applications. Skilled in full-stack development, system
                design, and leading engineering teams.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a Full Stack Lead Engineer, I have designed end-to-end application architectures, set up scalable
                boilerplates, and driven technical decisions across the SDLC.
                My work spans building rich, responsive frontends using Angular, React and Oracle APEX, developing
                robust backend services with Node.js, NestJS, and Java (1.8), and architecting efficient data layers
                using
                Oracle 19c, PL/SQL, Oracle NoSQL (SODA), and MongoDB.
                I have implemented real-time and high-throughput event-driven systems leveraging Kafka and Redis,
                while ensuring reliable delivery pipelines and containerized environments through Docker and GitHub
                workflows. My testing approach is strengthened by Jest. I also have hands-on experience with Oracle
                Goldengate to setup data integration in various pattern.
                I actively explore integrating AI/ML-driven automation and intelligence into modern application
                features.
                In a leadership capacity, I regularly evaluate technical proposals, align them with system architecture
                patterns, and make decisions that best fit business, scalability, and performance needs.
